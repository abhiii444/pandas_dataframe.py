# pandas_dataframe.py
This project is a Pandas DataFrame Exploration Script that demonstrates how to create, manipulate, index, slice, filter, modify, and analyze DataFrames using the Python Pandas library. It includes examples of DataFrame creation, column/row selection using loc and iloc, conditional filtering, adding/removing columns, performing operations.
# Pandas DataFrame Operations & Exploration

This repository contains a complete Python script that demonstrates how to work with **Pandas DataFrames**, including creation, indexing, slicing, filtering, modifying, and performing operations on data.  
The script is beginner-friendly and covers all essential DataFrame functionalities used in real-world data analysis.
